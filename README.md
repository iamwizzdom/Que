## About Que Framework
Que is an evolving PHP framework focused on runtime speed. We believe PHP is much faster than people perceive it to be.
Que has tried to unleash the full speed of PHP while still offering the simplicity of a typical framework making development fun and easy.

> Frameworks create a layer on a programming language, making the language more friendly to use.
Already existing PHP frameworks create this same layer on PHP. 
But one thing common with these PHP frameworks is that they place
more priority on developer experience than runtime speed. 
Some of them even reduce PHP runtime speed by upto 30%, making people believe that PHP isn't fast enough.

## What Que did
Que put a layer on PHP but retained it's runtime speed, by optimizing much background processing which tends to slowdown PHP.

Que makes development seem easy by beautifully implementing such common tasks such as:

- Routing
- Dynamic database connection
- Multiple templating engine
- Multiple session, state and caching storage
- Centralized modeling
- Detailed error logging

Que is organized, however Que adapts with disorganized developers. 
In other words, with Que's super-fast autoload engine, Que can locate your PHP files 
and include them in runtime no matter where you place these files within your project.

> **Que** is reliable, **Que** is fast, **Que** is PHP.
